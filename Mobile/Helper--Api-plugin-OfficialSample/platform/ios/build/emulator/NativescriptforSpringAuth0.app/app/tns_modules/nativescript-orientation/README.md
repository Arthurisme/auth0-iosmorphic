# nativescript-orientation
A NativeScript plugin to deal with Declarative UI and Screen Orientation
This handles both sides of the orientation issues;  both the events on when the orientation changes; and the ability to change the orientation manually.

## Installation 

tns plugin add nativescript-orientation  


## Usage

```````````To use the module you just `require()` it:

 
```js
require( "nativescript-orientation" );
```

This plugin has two separate abilities; the first ability is to setup the cool ability to run a function and setup the css when the screen is rotated.
For this ability, you do NOT need to keep a reference to it for the orientation event handling and css.  You only need to load it once.   I recommend you add it to your app.js file and forget about it.
It will automatically attach its methods to all the proper classes in the NativeScript library making it act as if they are built in.
What this does is automatically add and remove the "landscape" to the current **Page**'s cssClass variable (and does other magic behind the scenes allowing it to actually work).  

If you want to manually control the orientation, then you will need to require it and use the functions you need.  


## You ask, how exactly does this help?
Well, guess what Cascading means in CSS?  
Yes, this means this works now: 

```css
StackLayout {
  background-color: red;
}

.landscape StackLayout {
  background-color: green;
}
```

So in portrait the background would be red, in landscape the color is green.

## Why use this?
You can set ALL the normal CSS values this way include width, height, font-size.
By using the css to control any normal items and your own page's exports.orientation to control anything not controllable by css you can change the look completely between Landscape/Portrait.


### You can add to any page you need it the following Function:
#### exports.orientation(args) 
##### args.landscape = true | false
##### args.page (depreciated) or args.object = the current page
This function (if exists) will be ran when the page is first opened so you can set any needed defaults. (This is ran at the same time as the PageNavigatedTo event)
This function (if exists) will be ran each time the orientation changes.
Unfortunately at this moment some items can't be controlled by CSS like orientation on ScrollView, so this allows you to control change those things when the orientation changes.


### Additional Helper Method

```js 
var orientation = require('nativescript-orientation');
``` 

#### orientation.getOrientation()
```js
  var orientation = require('nativescript-orientation');
  console.log(orientation.getOrientation());  // Returns the enum DeviceOrientation value
```
 
#### orientation.setOrientation(direction, animation)
##### Direction - "portrait" | "landscape" | "landscapeleft" | "landscaperight" | enum DeviceOrientation
##### Animation === false, disabled animation on iOS.  (iOS ONLY currently)
This will automatically disable rotation support after it changes the orientation.
```js
  var orientation = require('nativescript-orientation');
  orientation.setOrientation("landscape");  
```
  

#### orientation.enableRotation() - enable orientation
This will enable automatic orientation support
```js
  var orientation = require('nativescript-orientation');
  orientation.enableRotation();  // The screen will rotate to whatever the current settings are...
```


#### orientation.disableRotation() - disables orientation
This will disable automatic orientation support and lock it to the current orientation
```js
  var orientation = require('nativescript-orientation');
  orientation.disableRotation(); // The screen will no longer rotate 
```
