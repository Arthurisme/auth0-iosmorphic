# auth0-iosmorphic

## A iosmorphic demo   
## Auth0 sync Nativescript (mobile) and website login and registration:  
###Angular 2 is used both in front-end website, and mobile(Nativescript).  
###Backend using Spring boot. Plan to using Jhipster when Jhipster release Angular 2 version.  


Note:
 
The auth0 nativescript plugin which now have been updated, and new version of autho nativescript plugin   is easy to use than old version.

In this repository it was using a very old version plugin which is difficult to configure and to use.

(I am now busy working in another project, So I have no time to updated this repository)

So please using new version of Auth0 nativescript plugin at here:
